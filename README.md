## Bump Chart of Maine's top 25 breweries since 2006.

A bump chart of Maine's top 25 craft breweries, using beer production volume data from the State of Maine. 

Forked from [Jim Vallandingham's D3 implementation of Henry Gannett's 1890 US Statistical Atlas population chart](https://bocoup.com/blog/vintage-visualization-restoration-bump-chart/).

Changes in this fork: 

* Removed "zoom" buttons in favor of a responsive layout (at screen widths less than 500 pixels wide, fewer year columns are displayed).
* Added sorting functions so that data could be loaded as raw volumes in the CSV file, rather than as rankings.
* Minor changes to label positions.
* Customized colors and clip paths in pills.js to go with the beer theme.
* Added vertical ranking labels that are displayed on mouseover events.

Many state alcohol and beer regulators keep brewery production data â€“ please re-use this code and let me know if you do!
